This is a prototype extension for (semi)auto emulation of in-lab studies that involve interruptions. It is designed to help researchers simulate and study the effects of interruptions on developers within the Visual Studio Code environment.

## Features

Mathematical Verification Tasks: The current implementation includes a series of mathematical problems that serve as interruption tasks. These tasks are presented to users based on their development activities.

Capturing these activities and defining their trigger are in development.

## Installation

To install this extension, clone the repository and open it in Visual Studio Code. You can then run the extension in a development instance of VS Code by pressing F5 or selecting Run > Start Debugging from the menu.
